# Qt Resources

QtPie builds on top of Qt and its Python bindings. Here are the official resources for learning more.

## Qt Documentation

- [Qt Documentation](https://doc.qt.io/) - Official Qt docs (C++ focused, but concepts apply)

## PySide6 (Recommended)

- [Qt for Python](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/) - Official PySide6 documentation
- [QtWidgets Reference](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/PySide6/QtWidgets/index.html) - All widget classes
- [PySide6 on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/)

## PyQt6

- [PyQt6 by Riverbank Computing](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/) - Official PyQt home
- [PyQt6 on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/)

## Which Should I Use?

**PySide6** is recommended because:

- Official Qt binding maintained by the Qt Company
- LGPL licensed (can use in commercial projects without licensing fees)
- Better long-term support

**PyQt6** is also excellent:

- Mature, battle-tested
- GPL licensed (requires open-source or commercial license)
- Slightly different signal/slot syntax in some edge cases

QtPie works identically with both. Pick one and go.
